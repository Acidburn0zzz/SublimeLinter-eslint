SublimeLinter-eslint 4.0.1 [BREAKING!]
--------------------------------------

We switched to the new SL4 selectors. Which are awesome.

This replaces the old syntax_map as a ways to get this to work with "vue"
or the "eslint-plugin-html", or even with "Javascript (babel, next)" etc.

By default, this plugin will now *only* select "source.js",
which should work with most vue/babel/next flavors and embedded code.

It's also configurable. Open your SublimeLinter settings and set it to e.g.:

    "eslint": {
        "selector": "source.js, text.html.basic"
    }


With the `eslint-plugin-html` installed, it will then take the whole file,
not just the scripts tags, and pass it to eslint.
Want it to grab `vue` files? "source.js, text.html.vue" for the win.


Other enhancements:

- We highlight errors that spread over multiple lines on ... multiple lines!
  So, if you have an empty "if" block, we highlight the entire block.

- You can target different node version by setting, e.g.:
    "executable": ["nvm", "exec", "8.9", "path/to/eslint"]
    "executable": ["i/compiled/this/node", "path/to/eslint"]

- You can tweak the execution environment by setting, e.g.:
    "env": {
        "PATH": "/some/additional/path/bin:$PATH"
    }
