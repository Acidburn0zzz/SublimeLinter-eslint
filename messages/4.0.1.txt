SublimeLinter-eslint 4.0.1
--------------------------


[BREAKING] again. We switched to the new SL4 selectors. What does that mean?
The whole `syntax` stuff and how I get this to work with `vue` or the
`eslint-plugin-html`, or even with "Javascript (super-next, next)" has been revisited.

By default, this plugin will now *only* select `source.js`
marked code, so it also lints embedded code in html.

But this is finally pluggable. Go to your settings, the User settings or
project settings, and set it to e.g.:

```
  "eslint": {
    "selector": "source.js, text.html.basic"
  }

```

*iff* you have the `eslint-plugin-html` installed. Then the plugin will take
the whole file, not just the scripts tags and pass it to eslint.

Want it to grab `vue` files: "source.js, text.html.vue" for the win.


Enhancement:

- We show errors that spread over multiple lines on ... multiple lines!
  So, if you have an empty if block, we select the block not the if.


Tips and tricks:

You can target different node version by setting, e.g.:

  `"executable": ["nvm", "exec", "8.9", "path/to/eslint"]`

  `"executable": ["i/compiled/this/node", "path/to/eslint"]`


You can tweak the execution environment:

  `"env": {
    "PATH": "/some/additional/path/bin:$PATH"
  }`
