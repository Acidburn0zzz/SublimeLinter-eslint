SublimeLinter-eslint 4.2.0
--------------------------

We can *fix* that!  We have two new settings:

- "filter_fixables" (true|false): If set to true, the plugin will ignore
  errors/warnings which are fixable.

- "fix_on_save" (true|false): If set to true, will attempt to auto-fix
  the source file. This is for pure '.js' files only atm.
